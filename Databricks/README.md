# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis (Python, PySpark, Databricks): 
This project performs a comprehensive data analysis on a simulated healthcare dataset from Kaggle. It showcases how **Python**, **Pandas**, and **PySpark** can be combined in **Databricks** to clean, transform, and analyze patient-level medical data efficiently.

## 📁 Dataset Overview: 
The dataset used in this project includes patient records with the following fields:
- `Name`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Blood Type`
- `Medical Condition`, `Date of Admission`, `Discharge Date`
- `Doctor`, `Hospital`, `Insurance Provider`
- `Billing Amount`, `Room Number`
- `Admission Type`, `Medication`, `Test Results`
- `Length of Stay`

## 🧪 Project Objectives: 
- Load and explore healthcare data using **Pandas**
- Create **Spark DataFrames** and register as temporary views
- Run complex **Spark SQL queries** for interactive exploration
- Perform filtering, grouping, and aggregations using PySpark
- Visualize key insights using **Databricks notebook display()**

## 💡 Key Learnings: 
- 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation with Pandas and PySpark
- 🔍 Querying large datasets using Spark SQL
- 💻 Working within the Databricks environment
- 📊 Data visualization for medical data insights

---

## 📓 Notebook: 
The project is implemented inside a Databricks notebook:
- `Healthcare_project(Python, Pyspark, Databricks).ipynb`

You can directly run it on Databricks Community Edition or any Databricks workspace.

## 🚀 How to Run: 
1. Upload the CSV file (`modified_healthcare_dataset.csv`) to `/dbfs/FileStore/tables/`
2. Open the Databricks notebook.
3. Execute the cells step-by-step.
